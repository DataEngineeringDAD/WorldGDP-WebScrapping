    "\n",
    "An international firm that is looking to expand its business in different countries across the world has recruited you. You have been hired as a junior Data Engineer and are tasked with creating an automated script that can extract the list of all countries in order of their GDPs in billion USDs (rounded to 2 decimal places), as logged by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Since IMF releases this evaluation twice a year, this code will be used by the organization to extract the information as it is updated.\n",

    "\n",
    "The required information needs to be made accessible as a **``CSV``** file **``Countries_by_GDP.csv``** as well as a table **``Countries_by_GDP``** in a database file **``World_Economies.db``** with attributes Country and **``GDP_USD_billion``**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your boss wants you to demonstrate the success of this code by running a query on the database table to display only the entries with more than a 100 billion USD economy. Also, you should log in a file with the entire process of execution named etl_project_log.txt.\n",
